Joe Stujenske, MD, PhD is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. He has dual-training as a basic neuroscientist and practicing psychiatrist. Dr. Stujenske completed his PhD work in the laboratory of Dr. Joshua Gordon at Columbia, followed by psychiatry residency and postdoctoral fellowship in the laboratory of Dr. Conor Liston at Weill Cornell. He started the Stujenske Lab in September 2023, and he is excited to contribute to a deeper understanding of the neural circuits that regulate behavior and autonomic responses. Under his leadership, the tools developed by the lab are shared openly, and collaboration is prioritized as a basis for successful and productive science.
