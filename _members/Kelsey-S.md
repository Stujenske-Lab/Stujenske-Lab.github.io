Kelsey Shimoda, BS Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, is a rotation student in the Stujenske Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh. She received her B.S at Oregon State University where she explored the effects of blue light on aging in fruit flies. After graduation, she worked as a postbaccalaureate fellow at the NIH studying morphine withdrawal in mice. She is interested in studying mechanisms underlying psychiatric diseases. For her rotation project, Kelsey is excited to map circuits involved in regulating defensive states in the whole mouse brain.
