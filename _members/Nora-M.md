Nora Miller, BS in Neuroscience, is a rotating PhD student in the Stujenske Lab at the University of Pittsburgh. As an undergraduate at Pitt, she studied cellular alterations to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia, and later transitioned to studying reward pathways and substance use in rats as a lab technician after graduation. She is broadly interested in studying the mechanisms underlying psychiatric disease. For her rotation project, Nora will be recording neuronal activity across the periaqueductal gray during defensive states using in vivo electrophysiology.
